Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.

It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!

What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.

Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.

Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.
